## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Google Chrome browser
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Step 1: Download the Extension

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Growfolio.git
   cd Growfolio
   ```

2. **Or download as ZIP**:
   - Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
   - Select "Download ZIP"
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend (Required)

The extension needs a backend server running to work properly.

#### Quick Setup:
```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd Growfolio

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Create environment file
# On Windows (Command Prompt):
copy backend\.env.example backend\.env

# On Mac/Linux:
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

#### Add Your API Keys:
1. Open `backend/.env` in a text editor
2. Get a free Gemini API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
3. Get a free Finnhub API key from: https://finnhub.io/
4. Add your keys to `.env`:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
   FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
   ```

#### Start the Backend Server:
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Keep this terminal open - the extension won't work without the backend running.

### Step 3: Install the Chrome Extension
