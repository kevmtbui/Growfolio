# Quick Start: Deploy to Railway with ML Models

## TL;DR - 5 Steps to Deploy

### 1. Upload Models to Hugging Face (One-time setup)

```bash
# Install Hugging Face CLI
pip install huggingface_hub

# Login
huggingface-cli login

# Edit upload_to_huggingface.py - change this line:
# REPO_NAME = "your-username/growfolio-models"

# Upload models (takes 10-30 min)
python upload_to_huggingface.py
```

### 2. Update Backend Config

Edit `backend/ml_loader.py` - change this line:
```python
REPO_NAME = "your-username/growfolio-models"  # Use YOUR Hugging Face username
```

### 3. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup Railway deployment"
git push origin railway-deployment
```
